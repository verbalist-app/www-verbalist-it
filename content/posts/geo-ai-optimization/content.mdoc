## What is Generative Engine Optimization?

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) represents the natural evolution of traditional SEO. With the advent of generative search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google SGE, optimizing content also means ensuring you get cited in AI responses.

## Why GEO Matters in 2026

Data shows that more and more users are using AI assistants for their searches. Being cited in these responses means:

- Greater brand visibility
- Qualified traffic from new sources
- Positioning as an authoritative source
- Competitive advantage over competitors

## How to Optimize for Generative Engines

The key is creating content that is easily "citable" by LLMs. This means structuring information clearly, with precise definitions and verifiable data.

> "Content optimized for GEO is no different from content optimized for users: clear, structured, and rich in value."

## Best Practices for GEO

Here are some concrete strategies to implement:

- **Clear definitions:** Start each section with a precise definition of the concept
- **Structured data:** Use tables, lists, and easily parsable formats
- **Citations and sources:** Include references to studies and verifiable data
- **FAQ section:** Answer frequently asked questions directly

## Conclusions

GEO doesn't replace traditional SEO, it complements it. An integrated approach that considers both classic search engines and generative ones is the winning strategy for 2026 and beyond.
